								Markets work well.  They are powerful mechanisms for quickly and continuously aggregating the wisdom of crowds.  Markets are highly &ldquo;efficient,&rdquo; meaning that the prices of market-based assets (stocks, bonds, etc.) already reflect all known information about that asset.  In other words, the price of every stock already incorporates everything that is known about the company, and any new information that comes along will immediately and efficiently be priced into the stock.
								<br><br>
								The implication of market efficiency is that attempts to &ldquo;beat&rdquo; the market &ndash; whether through stock picking, manager selection, or market timing &ndash; are highly unlikely to succeed.  Worse yet, attempts to beat the market are also very costly (in terms of both fees and taxes), which nearly guarantees that it will be a losing bet for those who attempt it.
								<br><br>
								While this is all counter-intuitive &ndash; it feels like smart people working hard should be able to beat the market &ndash; an overwhelming amount of both academic and real-world evidence has proven otherwise.
								<br><br>
								Fortunately for investors, long-term market returns are also powerful.  Those willing to accept these returns &ndash; rather than try to beat them &ndash; will not only outperform the vast majority of those trying to do better, but will also realize how robust these returns become when compounded over time.
								<br><br>
								By owning passive/index funds (such as those offered by <a href="#" target="_blank">Dimensional Fund Advisors</a> and <a href="#" target="_blank">Vanguard</a>, investors can fully capture these powerful long-term market returns at a very low cost.
